Dueling Aces is a pong game redesigned to look like a tennis match. It has dynamic wind, a power hit powerup, and the ability to add spin.

Wind is always changing, it could work against you, or for you.

A power up spawns every start of the round, who ever collects it that round gets the power up. A player can activate their power to launch the ball at high speeds directly across the map.

Spin can be applied to the ball by a player. Spin effects how the ball bounces off of the next wall it hits. Use of spin can throw your opponent off guard.
 
High spin causes the ball to bounce slower towards a player, but faster towards the other wall. 

Low spin causes the ball to bounce faster towards a player, but slower towards the other wall.
